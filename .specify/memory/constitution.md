# Rust LLM Voice Chat Framework Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rust-First Architecture

Every component is built with Rust as the primary language; Rust's ownership model, zero-cost abstractions, and memory safety guarantee system reliability; All performance-critical paths leverage Rust's native capabilities without external runtime dependencies.

### II. Offline-First Design

System operates entirely offline without internet connectivity; All LLM models, STT/TTS engines, and voice processing run locally; Data persistence and caching ensure functionality without network access.

### III. Voice Interface Standards

STT/TTS integration follows Web Speech API patterns for consistency; Audio processing supports multiple formats (WAV, MP3, Opus); Voice quality maintained at 16kHz minimum with noise reduction and echo cancellation.

### IV. LLM Integration Framework

Modular LLM backend supports multiple model formats (GGML, GGUF, ONNX); Plugin architecture for easy model swapping; Standardized prompt engineering and response parsing across different LLM providers.

### V. Performance and Reliability

Sub-500ms response times for voice interactions; Memory usage under 2GB for typical conversations; System remains stable under continuous voice input; Automatic recovery from audio processing failures.

## Technical Architecture

Technology stack requirements: Rust 1.70+, Tokio async runtime, Tauri for desktop integration, Whisper.cpp for STT, Coqui TTS for speech synthesis, llama.cpp for LLM inference.

Compliance standards: Audio processing meets industry standards for voice quality; LLM outputs filtered for safety and appropriateness; System designed for 24/7 operation with minimal maintenance.

## Development Standards

Code review requirements: All changes reviewed by team members with Rust expertise; Performance benchmarks included in PRs; Audio samples tested for quality regression.

Testing gates: Unit tests for all Rust modules; Integration tests for voice pipelines; End-to-end tests for complete conversation flows; Performance tests ensure latency requirements met.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use constitution.md for runtime development guidance.
